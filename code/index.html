        A cookie is a piece of text that a web site can store on a user's hard disk and later retrieve. When you visit a website, the website sends the cookie to your computer. Your computer stores it in a file located inside your web browser.

    <p class=info>
        With cookies websites can remember information such as items added in the shopping cart in an online store (without cookies, your shopping cart would reset to zero every time you clicked a new link on the site!). Cookies also make it possible for websites to record the user's browsing activity, including logging in and clicking particular buttons. They can also be used to remember pieces of information that the user previously entered into form fields such as names, addresses and passwords.
